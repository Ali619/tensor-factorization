Current Plots & Their Insights:

1. Heatmap

- Shows the overall interaction patterns between users and items
- Helps identify "hot" and "cold" zones of interaction
- Reveals if there are any systematic patterns or biases
- Can show clustering of similar users or items
- Good for spotting anomalies or unusual patterns

2. User Behavior Analysis (Error bar plot)
- Shows how consistently each user interacts with items
- Large error bars indicate users with highly variable behavior
- Small error bars suggest consistent user preferences
- Helps identify "stable" vs "volatile" users

3. Item Performance Distribution (Density plot)
- Shows how item ratings are distributed
- Reveals if items tend to perform similarly or vary widely
- Can identify if there's a normal distribution or multiple peaks
- Helps understand the general "health" of your recommendation system

4. Correlation Matrix:
- Items frequently recommended together
- Competing items
- Complementary items
- Item categories (through clustering)

5. Top/Bottom Items Analysis (Bar plots)
- Identifies best and worst performing items
- Useful for immediate actionable insights
- Helps in understanding what makes items successful or unsuccessful
- Good for business decisions about item promotion or removal
- User Clustering Analysis (Scatter plot)

6. User Engagement Level:
- Distribution of user activity
- Identify power users vs casual users
- Help in understanding user segments
- Guide user engagement strategies

7. Item Coverage Analysis would reveal:
- Cold start problems
- Over-exposed items
- Under-utilized items
- Recommendation diversity issues

8. Recommendation Strength Distribution
- Overall system characteristics
